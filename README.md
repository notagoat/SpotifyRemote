# SpotifyRemote
The terminal spotify remote nobody really needs!

Simply put, It's a python script that executes DBUS commands to control spotify from the terminal because I'm too lazy too alt-tab to spotify when I'm using the terminal.

Installation is pretty easy. Download it, use chmod +x and then run it with Python3.
